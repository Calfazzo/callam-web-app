    "summary": "I have always had a passion for the culinary arts and the food industry. This passion led me to explore a career in the culinary world that I am motivated to progress within. I have lived and worked all over the world, which has fuelled a love of travel and discovering new cuisine. I draw most of my influences from my English heritage as well as from my time living in both Germany and The USA. Drawing from my past experiences led me to medal in many competitions, such as winning gold at the welsh international culinary competition. During the summer of 2015, I was fortunate enough to work at Il Buco, a Michelin star restaurant in Italy, this gave me the drive to pursue a career creating world class meals that I have today.",
